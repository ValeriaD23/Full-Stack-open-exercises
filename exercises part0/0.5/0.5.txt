note over browser:
When you create a new note in a Single-page application(SPA), you'll
notice that the browser sends only one HTTP POST request to the server.
All of the logic is on the server, and the browser
only renders the HTML as instructed.
end note

note over browser:
The browser executes the Javascript code it fetched from the server. This Java-
script code fetches the notes as JSON-data and adds HTML elements for displaying
the notes using the DOM API.
